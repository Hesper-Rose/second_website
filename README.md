# Sample Website

This second (2nd) sample website is a hybrid of instructions from [*Learn Enough™ Git to Be
Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial) and [*Ry's Git Tutorial*](https://www.amazon.com/Rys-Git-Tutorial-Ryan-Hodson-ebook/dp/B00QFIA5OC/).

 When you just can't get enough Git, you combine two (2) different tutorials which use two (2) different hosting systems. Frustrating and challenging, this goes out to overachievers everywhere.

 Special thanks to [*The Odin Project*](https://www.theodinproject.com) for making this all possible. ❤️
